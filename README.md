Project Preview: Data Manipulation for Customer and Product Tables

Overview
This project focuses on the effective management and manipulation of data within a relational database, specifically through the use of Data Manipulation Language (DML). The core of this project involves two pivotal tables: the Customer Table and the Product Table. These tables are integral for managing customer information and product details, essential for operational efficiency and decision-making.



Integration and Usage
These tables are designed to work in tandem, with potential links to other tables such as Order and Sales tables to facilitate comprehensive data management. For instance, customer orders can be tracked and managed by linking customer data with product data through an Orders Table.

Benefits
- **Enhanced Data Management:** Streamlined processes for managing customer and product information.
- **Improved Reporting:** Efficient querying capabilities for generating insightful reports.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Accurate and up-to-date data supports better business decisions.
